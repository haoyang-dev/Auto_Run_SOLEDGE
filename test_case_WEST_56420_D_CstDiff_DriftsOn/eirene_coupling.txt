Which short cycling modes would you like to use for each level?
2 numbers separated by comma, first for level 1 (outer), second for level 2 (inner). The level 2 mode has to be lower than the level 1 mode.
Convention: 1 = constant sources, 2 = sources recalculated based on rescaled neutral density with plasma outflux, 3 = sources recalculated based on rescaled neutral density and updated plasma fields, 6 = rescaled sources to ensure particle conservation, nothing else updated.
